Courier pythonfilter
====================

pythonfilter is a framework for developing courierfilter programs in
Python.  The pythonfilter program itself is a multi-threaded daemon
that loads filters as python modules and passes the control and data
files from courier to each module in turn.

pythonfilter includes several modules that provide utility functions.
These modules are found in the "courier" directory.  The "config"
module provides functions to access or interpret Courier's
configuration settings.  The "control" module provides functions
to interpret Courier's control files.

 o Courier - http://www.courier-mta.org/

 o Python 2 or better - http://www.python.org/

 o pydns - http://pydns.sourceforge.net/


Hacking
=======

Filters are used as modules.  Each filter should start by initializing
any settings or modules that it needs to function properly.  The final
step in initialization should be writing a status message to stderr.
e.g.:

  sys.stderr.write( 'Initialized the foo python filter\n' )

Filters may provide a global variable called "order" which specifies
in what order the modules will be run.  Modules with greater "order"
values will be run later.  The "order" value is only used immediately
after loading the module.  After that, it is no longer important.

Filters may have as many functions as required, but they must provide
at least one function, called "dofilter", declared as:

  def dofilter( message_body, message_ctrl_files ):
     ...

This function will be called to filter each incoming message.  This
function should return either the empty string ('') to indicate
success, and that other filters may run, or it should return an SMTP
style response.  The response will be passed on directly to Courier,
and in the case of failure responses, passed on to the client sending
the message.  A filter may return an SMTP success code ('200 Ok') to
indicate that the message is OK, and that no further filters should
run.

Last, and most important: Each filter is run in a thread.  Take care
to ensure that your filter is thread safe when writing them.  If you
modify global variables in your functions, you should protect them
with a mutex.  Take care as well to verify that your resources are
cleaned up properly.  Resource leaks can spring up, and will lead
to Courier rejecting mail.
