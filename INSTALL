Basic Installation
==================

pythonfilter uses Distutils to ease installation. The majority of
people should be able to install & run pythonfilter by entering:

   python setup.py install

   mkdir /var/state/pythonfilter
   chown daemon:daemon /var/state/pythonfilter

   ln -s /usr/bin/pythonfilter /usr/lib/courier/libexec/filters

The dialback filter requires pydns, which in turn requires Python 2+.
If your "python" is not version 2 or newer, you may be able to install
a newer python as "python2" (as in Red Hat Linux < 8) and specify the
interpreter on the command line above.

The directory /var/state/pythonfilter is required for persistent data
used by some of the filters.  It should be owned by the user and group
that Courier's mail daemon runs as.  Check MAILUSER and MAILGROUP in
your esmtpd configuration file.

If you did not install Courier's configuration files in /etc/courier,
you'll need to fix the sysconf value near the beginning of
courier/config.py.  You may also need to fix the values of prefix and
spool in that file.


Optional Filters
================

You may choose not to install any filter using the argument
--without-filter and the name of the filter file.  e.g.:

   python setup.py install --without-filter ratelimit.py
