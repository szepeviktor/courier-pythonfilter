Basic Installation
==================

pythonfilter uses Distutils to ease installation. The majority of
people should be able to install & run pythonfilter by entering:

   python setup.py install

   mkdir /var/state/pythonfilter
   chown daemon:daemon /var/state/pythonfilter

   ln -s /usr/bin/pythonfilter /usr/lib/courier/libexec/filters
   
   filterctl start pythonfilter

The dialback filter requires pydns.  It can be found here:
http://pydns.sourceforge.net/

The directory /var/state/pythonfilter is required for persistent data
used by some of the filters.  It should be owned by the user and group
that Courier's mail daemon runs as.  Check MAILUSER and MAILGROUP in
your esmtpd configuration file.

If you installed Courier in an uncommon location, you may need to
change the values of sysconf, prefix, and spool near the beginning of
courier/config.py.  The module will try to detect common locations.

The configuration file, "pythonfilter.conf" is installed in /etc by
default.  List the filters that you want to use in the configuation
file.  Each line should be the name of one of the filters in the
"pythonfilter" module.
